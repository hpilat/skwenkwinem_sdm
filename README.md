# skwenkwinem_sdm
This repository hosts scripts for running tidysdm with skwenkwínem 
(Claytonia lanceolata) occurrence records in a species distribution model. 

Please run scripts 01 through 12 to reproduce the study published at https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.72615.

This study's pre-registration is located at: https://osf.io/rm9s2/overview 
Scripts are also available at: https://osf.io/m4u8q/overview along with instructions and output files. 

Code lines associated with Skeetchestn have been annotated out, since the 
Skeetchestn Territory files are not publicly available. As such, script
10_area_calculations_skeetch will not run.
